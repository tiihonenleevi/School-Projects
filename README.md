**School Projects**
This repository contains a collection of my school projects that I want to share. Below is a list of the projects along with short descriptions of each.

**Projects**
Hangman (Hirsipuupeli)
A simple Hangman game created during the Programming 1 course.
This project focuses on building a functional GUI application.

Battleship (Laivanupotus)
A Battleship game developed in the Programming 1 course.
Its main goal was to practice object-oriented programming principles.

Path
A project from the Programming 3 course.
I implemented gameboard.cpp and the unit tests together with a friend.
The main.cpp and gameboard.hh were provided by the course staff, but everything inside the private section of gameboard.hh as well as getPlayArea() was implemented by us.

Chess
A project from the Programming 3 course.
A simplified chess game implemented with a graphical user interface using Qt. The project was completed in collaboration with a teammate.
Our contributions:
- Implemented Rook, Bishop, Queen, and King classes with correct movement rules.
- Added helper methods `check_moves_in_direction` and `check_moves_diagonally` to the ChessPiece class to simplify calculating allowed moves.
- Developed the interactive 8x8 chessboard GUI, showing piece graphics, highlighting allowed moves, and updating game state.
- Integrated the GUI with the underlying Chess, ChessBoard, and ChessPiece logic.
This project strengthened skills in GUI development, object-oriented design, modular programming, and collaborative development.
