**School Projects**
This repository contains a collection of my school projects that I want to share. Below is a list of the projects along with short descriptions of each.

**Projects**
Hangman (Hirsipuupeli)
A simple Hangman game created during the Programming 1 course.
This project focuses on building a functional GUI application.

Battleship (Laivanupotus)
A Battleship game developed in the Programming 1 course.
Its main goal was to practice object-oriented programming principles.

Path
A project from the Programming 3 course.
I implemented gameboard.cpp and the unit tests together with a friend.
The main.cpp and gameboard.hh were provided by the course staff, but everything inside the private section of gameboard.hh as well as getPlayArea() was implemented by us.
