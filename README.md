This is a repository for my school projects that I want to share.

List of the projects and some information about each of them:

- Hangman: I made this game in the course "Programming 1" as a project that utilizes GUI
- Battleship: I made this game in the course "Programming 1" as a project that utilizes object-oriented programming
